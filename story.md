## Level 1 welcome screen and first puzzle

The goal of this game is to use your knowledge of web technology, programming and hacking techniques to get from
level to level, using any legal method. Each level is slightly more difficult than the previous one.
Your task in each level is to find a password that will lead you to the next level. We wish you a lot
of fun while hacking/playing.

## Level 2 

Dr. Riddler: How... how did you get there? This is a hidden place! You are not allowed to be here! How is it even possible?
Dr. Riddler: By the way, I am Dr. Riddler, the creator of this world, MY WORLD! I will stop you from continuing until you show me that you are worth being here.
Dr. Riddler: It looks like you have a lot of experience. Then let's put you to the test. I will keep it easy, for now... hahahahaha.

## Level 3

Dr. Riddler: It seems you are really wild! You must belong to the Wild Devs. I didn't know that...
Dr. Riddler: But now, you have to look deeper. Sometimes we don't see the obvious.

## Level 4

Dr. Riddler: Do you like jokes? No? I will tell you anyway.

	Two strings walk into a bar and sit down. The bartender says, “So what'll it be?”
	The first string says, “I think I'll have a beer quag fulk boorg jdk^CjfdLk jk3s d#f67howe%^U r89nvy~~owmc63^Dz x.xvcu”
	“Please excuse my friend,” the second string says, “He isn't null-terminated.”

## Level 5 

Dr. Riddler: Okay okay, it's enough. This is the end of the road for you.
Dr. Riddler: I'm closing all the doors now. You are trapped here and there is no escape. I win, you lose, HAHAHAHAHA

From a dark corner comes a quiet whisper

Unknown: Psssst, don't look at me, I'm hiding from Dr. Riddler. He keeps me imprisoned here too in his cruel world, but I escaped this level.
Unknown: He is hashing his levels in the url. You need to escape too and meet me in the "level6", I will wait for you.

## Level 6

Unknown: Hey there! I'm glad that you figured it out how to escape Dr. Riddler.
Betty: I'm Betty, been here for a while and stuck at this level.
Betty: Can you help me to get out of here? I don't like this dark place.

It's so dark here that Betty and you can't see anything, but she's sure there must be something.

## Level 7

Betty: There is light! THERE IS LIGHT! Can you see it? FINALLY. THANK YOU &#128149;
Betty: Let's continue. Light it up and open the door.

## Level 8

Betty: Mh... it still... dark here and scary.
Betty: We need to find more hints to get out of here.

Dr. Riddler: Hey! What are you doing here?! Where do you want to go? THERE IS NO ESCAPE! 
Dr. Riddler: I will make sure that you will not get any futher. You are my hostages here IN my world!
